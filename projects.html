<!-- INCEPT Algorithm Section -->
<div style="margin: 30px 0;">
  <h2>INCEPT Algorithm</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    The INCEPT algorithm was independently designed by me with the goal of achieving high pruning rates while maintaining model performance. The algorithm has demonstrated impressive results, achieving up to a 97% pruning rate on the Humanoid and several MuJoCo tasks without sacrificing the accuracy of the model. This is a significant breakthrough in the field of neural network pruning, as it outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of training cost, model accuracy, and pruning rate. The INCEPT algorithm is currently being prepared for submission to Nature Machine Intelligence, where we hope to share our findings with the broader research community.

  <h3>Humanoid Pruning Visualization</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Below is a visualization of a humanoid model with only 3,000 parameters. Despite the reduction in parameters, the pruned model performs similarly to the original model, which has 100,000 parameters. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the INCEPT algorithm in reducing model complexity while maintaining high performance.

  <h3>Walker2D Network Pruning Visualization</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Below is the visualization of the Walker2D model after pruning. The image clearly shows the network's connection pattern post-pruning, where the critical connections are maintained while the non-essential ones are removed. This pruning process not only optimizes the network but also makes it more interpretable.

<!-- PPO Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance on CARLA Platform Section -->
<div style="margin: 30px 0;">
  <h2>PPO Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance on CARLA Platform</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    In this project, I implemented PPO for real-time obstacle avoidance on the CARLA simulation platform, a popular platform for autonomous driving research. The goal was to train an agent to navigate a complex environment while avoiding obstacles in real time. This project was part of a course project, and I was responsible for implementing the PPO algorithm, tuning the hyperparameters, and optimizing the training process.

    Below is a video showing the PPO agent navigating the CARLA platform, avoiding obstacles, and successfully reaching its navigation point.
