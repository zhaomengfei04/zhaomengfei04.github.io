    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 0;">I am a third-year student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Intelligent Science within the Computer Science and Engineering Department. My supervisor is Ran Cheng, who is an associate professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I will be participating in the UCSD 2025 Spring Extension Program. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Currently, I am working on combining pruning and optimization in Reinforcement Learning, and after completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. I am the leader of the EMI NeuroEvolution subgroup, and my passion for research drives me to build a systematic understanding of problems and develop new insights.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">In my spare time, I also explore topics in probability theory, abstract algebra, and convex optimization to further enhance my knowledge in mathematics. I truly enjoy studying math, as it allows me to build deeper and more structured insights into various problems.</p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: left; color: #777; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reinforcement Learning | Neural Network Pruning | Continual Leanrning | Optimization Theory | Evolutionary Computation</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    My current research focuses on combining optimization and pruning techniques to find the most minimal yet effective models in Reinforcement Learning. I am particularly interested in optimization processes, including policy gradient optimization and non-gradient optimization based on Evolutionary Strategy (ES). My work has led me to realize that overparameterization is not necessarily about needing so many parameters for neural networks to express themselves; instead, it is a strategy that helps with the optimization process. Additionally, I am very interested in continual learning, and I am exploring how these areas can be integrated to improve RL systems.

  <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    During my time as a member of the EMI Group, I contributed to the development of TensorNEAT, a tool aimed at optimizing neural networks. I played a key role in simplifying the NEAT algorithm design and optimizing its hyperparameters. Furthermore, I worked on implementing tensorization and parallel computing techniques for Evolutionary Strategy (ES), significantly improving the computational performance and speed of the algorithm.

    As the leader of the EMI NeuroEvolution subgroup, I currently lead a team of five members in exploring the combination of optimization and pruning techniques in reinforcement learning (RL) problems. Our team has achieved state-of-the-art pruning rates while also improving model accuracy and training efficiency. We are currently preparing to submit a paper on our <strong>INCEPT</strong> method to <em style="color: #9b59b6;">Nature Machine Intelligence</em>, with me as the <strong style="color: #9b59b6;">first author</strong>.
