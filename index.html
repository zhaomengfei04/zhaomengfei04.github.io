    <p style="font-size: 16px;">I am a third-year student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Intelligent Science within the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I will be participating in the UCSD 2025 Spring Extension Program.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Currently, I am working on combining pruning and optimization in Reinforcement Learning, and after completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in RL. I am the leader of the EMI NeuroEvolution subgroup, and my passion for research drives me to build a systematic understanding of problems and develop new insights.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">In my spare time, I also explore topics in probability theory, abstract algebra, and convex optimization to further enhance my knowledge in mathematics. I truly enjoy studying math, as it allows me to build deeper and more structured insights into various problems.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    My current research focuses on combining optimization and pruning techniques to find the most minimal yet effective models in Reinforcement Learning. I am particularly interested in optimization processes, including policy gradient optimization and non-gradient optimization based on Evolutionary Strategy (ES). My work has led me to realize that overparameterization is not necessarily about needing so many parameters for neural networks to express themselves; instead, it is a strategy that helps with the optimization process. Additionally, I am very interested in continuous learning, transfer learning, and world models, and I am exploring how these areas can be integrated to improve RL systems.

  <h3>Evolving Machine Intelligence (EMI) Group</h3>
  <p><strong>Member</strong> | <em>July 2023 – December 2023</em></p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    During my time as a member of the EMI Group, I contributed to the development of TensorNEAT, a tool aimed at optimizing neural networks. I played a key role in simplifying the NEAT algorithm design and optimizing its hyperparameters. Furthermore, I worked on implementing tensorization and parallel computing techniques for Evolutionary Strategy (ES), significantly improving the computational performance and speed of the algorithm.

  <h3>EMI NeuroEvolution Subgroup </h3>
  <p><strong>Leader</strong> | <em>December 2023 – Present</em></p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    As the leader of the EMI NeuroEvolution subgroup, I currently lead a team of five members in exploring the combination of zero-order optimization and pruning techniques in reinforcement learning (RL) problems. Our team has achieved state-of-the-art pruning rates while also improving model accuracy and training efficiency. We are currently preparing to submit a paper on our INCEPT method to <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em>, with me as the first author.
