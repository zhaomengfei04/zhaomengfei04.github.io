### Introduction

I am a third-year student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), currently majoring in Intelligent Science within the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I will be participating in the UCSD 2025 Spring Extension Program. 

Currently, I am working on combining pruning and optimization in Reinforcement Learning. After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of RL.

*“To seek meaning through passion, and to prove it through dedication.”*
